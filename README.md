# Yuyo´s Utility Pad
Yuyo´s Utility Pad is a 6 key macropad that i designed in my free time as a way to learn new things

## Components
- 6 keys support
- a hidden led inside the case :)
- stickers (that i´ll add on the future)

## Files
On the folders you can find all the files that are used in this project but here is an overview so you can understand my view of it:

- Case:
  It is a simple case, the bottom is where the pcb is stored, the top just has the holes for the keycaps. The usb c port comes out thanks to a cut on the back of the case.
  I wanted to keep it simple so i could put stickers on it (i can´t decide between cat or alien)}

-PCB:
  The switches are arranged in a way that i like to call "wasd without the s", i couldn´t decide between a more conventional way and this one, but i think that it could be more useful      this way (it could be very nice for rythm games). On the center is the XIAO RP2040 and a LED that i hope it can be seen between the switch spaces.

-Code:
  I wanted to use Circuitpython mainly because i want to learn more about python in general, it´s something that i want to do but i never find a real motivation to do it, and this is a     good one.

## Materials

## Extra
This project was very fun to do, i fell in love with fusion 360 and kicad was really fun to use. I don´t remember when was the las time that i was so excited with a project so this was so awesome :).
